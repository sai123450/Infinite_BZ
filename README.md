## Latest Updates (Jan 2026) -> "Antigravity" Refactor

### Create Event Page Overhaul
*   **Split-Screen Layout**: Implemented a responsive 60/40 grid layout with a scrollable form and sticky live preview.
*   **Antigravity Design**: Floating dock, glassmorphism effects, glowing borders, and smooth slide-down animations.

### Event Detail UI Refactor
*   **Pro-Level Dashboard Modal**: Internal "InfiniteBZ" events now open in a premium, glassmorphic modal instead of redirecting externally.
*   **Smart Layout**: 
    *   **Desktop**: Sticky sidebar keeps engagement actions (Price, Register) always visible.
    *   **Mobile**: Fluid scrolling layout prevents content overlap.
*   **Auto-Registration**: Seamless one-click registration integration with the backend API.
*   **Source Differentiation**: Visual indicators (Eye vs External Link) to distinguish between Community Events and External Listings (Eventbrite/Meetup).
*   **Image Upload**: Integrated local file upload support for custom event cover images.

### My Events & Interaction Refactor (Jan-2 2026)

    *   **Actionable UI**: Integrated Search, Sort (Newest/Oldest), and Delete functionality with immediate UI updates.
*   **Create Event Refinement**:
    *   **Dark Theme Enforcement**: Strict adherence to `bg-slate-900`/`text-white` with `cyan-500` accents.
    *   **Rich Content**: Added support for comprehensive **Agenda** and **Speaker** profiles.
*   **Backend Flexibility**: 
    *   Updated `Event` model to store rich content (Agenda/Speakers) in a flexible `raw_data` JSONB column, avoiding rigid schema migrations.
*   **Unified Navigation**: `EventFeed` now consistently opens the detailed internal modal for *all* events, improving the user journey.
